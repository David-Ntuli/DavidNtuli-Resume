         I am a decorated finance professional who has worked in the field during college. During the summer of my freshman year, I worked as a consultant at Boeing and received high honors from my accompanying staff for diligence and commitment. Last year, I attended an internship with Verizon in Indiana. There I had an opportunity to work closely with accounting professionals. My day-to day tasks included the recording, filing, and general manipulation of accounting information the company received on a daily basis. This work experience taught me the value of diligence and transparency as the work could not be completed efficiently unless all of my work was flawless and my workmates knew how far along I was at all times.
My junior college coursework afforded my an abundance of opportunities to practice accounting skills applicable to the job setting using Stat Crunch and ExcelI directed hospital visitors to the rooms of the patients they wanted to visitI recorded patient entrance and departure from the hospital and forwarded the information to the involved parties within the hospital. The position emphasized people skills and adherence to protocol
 My mechanical talents include bookkeeping, public speech, leadership, and financial calculation. I aspire to lead a team of finance professionals to make calculations and conduct research in order to optimize capital budget decision making within a firm. As a worker, my most profound shortcoming is a lack of experience. This summer, I plan on acquiring more work experience which I will use to become a more well-rounded officer prepared for employment.
 <br><br>

        I have years of experience practicing and competing in speech and debate tournaments spanning my high school and college careers. My specialties are impromptu and after dinner speech categories. To compete in such categories, I developed a level of charisma and quick thinking that helps me articulate myself fully and succinctly so as to address multiple topics while retaining listener attention. I have experience using Microsoft Excel to make and update accounting sheets and graphs. 
Skills that I am working on improving at present include networking, and remote working. I understand that in this digital age, communication through digital mediums distinguishes bigger companies from smaller ones and strive to distinguish myself as a worker who respects and attempts to expedite this process however I can. I am working with a number of non profit organizations at present to build homes for the needy and have started a gofundme page to acquire the funds. I believe that intuition and consciousness to be the most valuable personality traits in a worker and try to demonstrate these traits in all that I do. I would like to work mor with children going foreward. I find that imparting knowledge and receiving knowledge from others is the most fulfilling part of any work day. To receive and give utility to others, especially the youth, gives me the  most satisfaction in a work setting.
